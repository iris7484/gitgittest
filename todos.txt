Welcome back! It's refresher time, yo. 

Do these things:

- Start styling the pages with a mobile first approach
- Apply the grid after you've made some headway based on the layout.png image in img/
	- NOTE! Not all of the container markup is there, you will need to add some clearfix divs.
- Add a slideshow to the front page using glide.js:
	- https://github.com/jedrzejchalubek/Glide.js
- Replace the contact for with "Thanks!" after it is submitted


Additional:

- Create the work.html page yourself 
	- You could create a grid-like gallery of the work images and use this plugin for a lightbox:
		- http://cocopon.me/app/vanillabox
- Apply some animations using animate.css (Google it)
- Use a webfont
- Add a favicon
- Use fontawesome.io to add some social network links
